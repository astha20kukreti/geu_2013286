Hadoop Common Module is a Hadoop Base API (A Jar file) for all Hadoop Components. All other components works on top of this module.
HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is also know as HDFS V2 as it is part of Hadoop 2.x with some enhanced features. It is used as a Distributed Storage System in Hadoop Architecture.
YARN stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator. It is new Component in Hadoop 2.x Architecture. It is also know as “MR V2”.
MapReduce is a Batch Processing or Distributed Data Processing Module. It is also know as “MR V1” as it is part of Hadoop 1.x with some updated features.
Remaining all Hadoop Ecosystem components work on top of these three major components: HDFS, YARN and MapReduce. We will discuss all Hadoop Ecosystem components in-detail in my coming posts.
When compared to Hadoop 1.x, Hadoop 2.x Architecture is designed completely different. It has added one new component : YARN and also updated HDFS and MapReduce component’s Responsibilities.
Hadoop 2.x Major Components
Hadoop 2.x has the following three Major Components:
HDFS
YARN
MapReduce
These three are also known as Three Pillars of Hadoop 2. Here major key component change is YARN. It is really game changing component in BigData Hadoop System.
All Master Nodes and Slave Nodes contains both MapReduce and HDFS Components.
One Master Node has two components:
Resource Manager(YARN or MapReduce v2)
HDFS
It’s HDFS component is also knows as NameNode. It’s NameNode is used to store Meta Data.

In Hadoop 2.x, some more Nodes acts as Master Nodes as shown in the above diagram. Each this 2nd level Master Node has 3 components:
Node Manager
Application Master
Data Node
Each this 2nd level Master Node again contains one or more Slave Nodes as shown in the above diagram.
These Slave Nodes have two components:
Node Manager
HDFS
It’s HDFS component is also knows as Data Node. It’s Data Node component is used to store actual our application Big Data. These nodes does not contain Application Master component.
